## Project 2 for NTU's database system principles

This is a tutorial on how to execute the project. 

The environment information is incorporated in environment.yaml for Conda environments, and requirements.txt for pip venv.

After loading and activating the environment, the project can be ran by running the file project.py in your preferred IDE, or in CLI: python3 project.py

The instruction and overview about the algorithm and the GUI can be found in the project.

The database configuration can be modified in database.ini, which would allow connection to different database schema, and carry out exploration on them.
